# MS-Repo
Welcome to my MagicSpells repository. This is a collection of both examples and ready-to-use 
spell systems for the MagicSpells Minecraft plugin. Of note is that these individual spell 
files may need other files, such as spells-infrastructure.yml or another spell file, to 
function. They may also need beta builds of the plugin (which are available to testers on the 
MS Discord).

Make sure to note the "version" numbers in each file's name. Older versions (0.0, 1.0, etc.)
may not work as expected, or may not even work at all. Chances are, I decided to share an
early iteration of the spell system for other people to learn from.

That being said, some of these spell files are highly experimental and can push the limits
of what is even possible with MagicSpells. If you find out some way to make a system work
even better, please make it known. That way, we can further the field and make the previously
impossible possible with a simple Minecraft plugin.

This repository also serves as my portfolio. (Keep an eye out on #looking-for-work. My discord
is sky#5095.)
