# MS-Repo
Welcome to my MagicSpells repository. This is a collection of examples, spell systems, and
other cool spell files to be used with the MagicSpells Minecraft server plugin. The spell
files do not need any outside plugins to function unless otherwise stated. The spell files
MAY need an infrastructure file (for universally used spells, like pains and dummies) to
function.

This repository also serves as my portfolio. DM me on discord (sky#5095) for rates.
